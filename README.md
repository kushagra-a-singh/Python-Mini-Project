# Python-Mini-Project
# *Spelling Bee Puzzle*
*This project consists of Python scripts for generating, solving and interacting with puzzles through GUI and CLI.*<br>
<br>Use the GUI or CLI to generate and play the puzzle:<br>
 - Run play_puzzle.py for CLI
 - And gui.py for GUI
 - Customize puzzle parameters in params.py as needed.

Issues:
- GUI puzzle display has some issues with dimensions of the window. Currently it is being fetched from play_puzzle.py file for the honeycomb design, but gets disturbed and changed by the GUI window resizes.
